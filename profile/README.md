## About Us

Welcome to the **Wellcome Connecting Science GitHub**!  
We offer open-access course materials covering a wide range of topics—from discovery research based on genomic technologies to the application of genomics in healthcare and public health.

All course data in these repositories are freely available for reuse, with appropriate attribution.

## 📁 What is a Course Repository?

A **course repository** is a dedicated GitHub space containing all resources related to a specific course. This includes:

- Lecture notes and slide decks
- Sample datasets and files for analysis
- Bioinformatics scripts and code examples
- Tutorials and hands-on exercises
- Software installation and troubleshooting guides

Each repository is designed to provide everything needed to follow the course independently or review the materials afterward.


## 🔗 What is a Course Landing Page?

Some courses are delivered multiple times or are part of ongoing programmes. For these, we’ve created **course landing pages**—centralized pages that consolidate:

- All related sessions and resources
- Up-to-date datasets and code
- Installation guides
- Instructor notes and participant materials
- Zenodo DOIs for citation

These landing pages are ideal for educators and learners looking for a complete overview of a course.

## Course Informatics Set-up

We primarily use **Oracle VirtualBox** for our informatics courses as it is open-source, cross-platform, and enables participants to seamlessly replicate the software environment after the course. For those who prefer a containerized setup, we also have started providing support for **Docker** containers. 

For installation and setup, please refer to the following guides:

- **[Oracle VM VirtualBox Installation Guide](https://github.com/WCSCourses/index/blob/main/VM_Guide.md)** – Detailed instructions for installing and configuring VirtualBox on different operating systems. *(Note: Separate installations are needed for Intel-based and ARM-based Macs, and the VDI files will differ.)*
- **[Docker Installation Guide](https://github.com/WCSCourses/index/blob/main/Docker_guide.md)** – Step-by-step guide for installing Docker on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

In virtual courses, we often use browser-based tools or **Google Colab**, allowing participants to run code without local installations. For more details, please refer to our **[Google Colab Guide](https://github.com/WCSCourses/index/blob/main/Google_Colab.md)**.

Most of the bioinformatics software covered in our course operates mainly on Linux operating systems, here is a list of useful resources for **[Linux Learning](https://github.com/WCSCourses/index/blob/main/linux_learning.md)**.
