## About Us

Welcome to the Wellcome Connecting Science GitHub repository! We have open courses from discovery research based on genomic technologies, to the application of genomics in healthcare and public health. All course data in these repositories are free for reuse with attribution.

## Interested in attending a course?

Take a look at what courses are coming up at [Wellcome Connecting Science Courses & Conference Website](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/our-events/).

## Course Repositories

The latest course repositories can be found here [Wellcome Connecting Science Courses Index](https://github.com/WCSCourses/index/blob/main/README.md).

The course repositories contain the following:
- Course materials including lecture notes, slides, and datasets.
- Code examples and scripts for bioinformatics and genomic analyses.
- Tutorials and practical exercises to complement the courses.

We have developed dedicated landing pages for courses that are offered regularly. These pages consolidate all pertinent materials and updates, facilitating easier access to content for both participants and educators. You can find the course landing pages linked below on the homepage and in the [Wellcome Connecting Science Courses Index](https://github.com/WCSCourses/index/blob/main/README.md).

## Course Informatics Set-up

We primarily use **Oracle VirtualBox** for our informatics courses as it is open-source, cross-platform, and enables participants to seamlessly replicate the software environment after the course. For those who prefer a containerized setup, we also have started providing support for **Docker** containers. 

For installation and setup, please refer to the following guides:

- **[Oracle VM VirtualBox Installation Guide](https://github.com/WCSCourses/index/blob/main/VM_Guide.md)** – Detailed instructions for installing and configuring VirtualBox on different operating systems. *(Note: Separate installations are needed for Intel-based and ARM-based Macs, and the VDI files will differ.)*
- **[Docker Installation Guide](https://github.com/WCSCourses/index/blob/main/Docker_guide.md)** – Step-by-step guide for installing Docker on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

In virtual courses, we often use browser-based tools or **Google Colab**, allowing participants to run code without local installations. For more details, please refer to our **[Google Colab Guide](https://github.com/WCSCourses/index/blob/main/Google_Colab.md)**.
